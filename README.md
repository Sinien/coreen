# Coreen

Coreen is a code reading environment. It aims to facilitate the process of
reading and understanding code. It is not an IDE, the primary goal of which is
authoring code, and only secondarily supports code reading and understanding.
That said, Coreen will necessarily overlap with the functionality of various
IDEs.

Coreen's functionality breaks down into three areas:

* search
* navigation
* visualization

Coreen is an extremely early work-in-progress. It presently works only with
Java source code (it is functionally code-agnostic under the hood but will
require per-language name resolvers). It also barely accomplishes basic code
display, but new functionality is being added daily.

## Try It

## Contact

Coreen is a research project being conducted by [Michael
Bayne](mailto:mdb@cs.washington.edu). Feel free to email him to let him know
that this is a crazy idea (crazy good, or crazy bad), or even better, that you
are interested in writing a name resolver for another language.
