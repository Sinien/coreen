Building Coreen
---------------

A fair number of manual steps are currently needed to set up a Coreen build.
These instructions will hopefully help you to navigate that twisty maze of
passages.

First, install a couple of actively changing dependent libraries. These require
Maven to build. If you don't already have it installed, I apologize for
bringing this horror into your life.

% cd somewherethatyouliketokeepprojects
% svn checkout http://ooo-gwt-utils.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ gwt-utils
% cd gwt-utils
% mvn clean install

% cd somewherethatyouliketokeepprojects
% svn checkout http://getdown.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ getdown
% cd getdown
% mvn clean install

You will also need coreen-java-reader if you don't already have it. It needs to
live under the coreen build directory in a directory named 'java-reader':

% cd coreen
% git clone clone git@github.com:samskivert/coreen-java-reader.git
% mv coreen-java-reader java-reader
% cd java-reader
% sbt update proguard

Now you should be able to compile and run Coreen:

% cd coreen
% sbt update run

This will build and run the Coreen server. Coreen is architected as a Java
server and a GWT web client. To run the web client (in GWT's development mode),
use the script in coreen/bin/gdevmode. In another shell, execute:

% cd coreen
% ./bin/gdevmode

(I'm assuming you're running Mac OS X or Linux. If you're on Windows, you're on
your own.)

That's it. You should now have a fully operational development installation of
Coreen. It is now time to get crazy with the Cheez Whiz.
